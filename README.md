# Course_work_for_HCV - Project: Real-Time Food Freshness Detection in Grocery Stores

## Introduction
As consumer demand for high-quality and fresh produce increases, maintaining consistent freshness standards in grocery stores has become crucial. However, assessing the freshness of fruits manually can be both labor-intensive and subjective, leading to variations in quality control. This project seeks to leverage computer vision to automate the freshness assessment process, providing a practical tool for real-time quality control in grocery stores.

## Problem Statement
Food waste is a major issue worldwide, with a significant portion stemming from unsold and spoiled produce in retail environments. Identifying and managing freshness levels efficiently can help reduce waste and enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring that only fresh produce is on display. This project addresses this need by developing a model capable of detecting different types of fruits and assessing their freshness in real-time.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a system that uses computer vision to identify various fruits in a grocery store setting and assign freshness scores or categories to each fruit in real-time. By overlaying this information on a live video feed, the system can serve as a powerful tool for automated quality control, enabling store staff to quickly identify and remove less fresh items.

## Approach
1. **Object Detection**: First, the system will employ an object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5) to identify and locate fruits in each frame of a video feed. This model will draw bounding boxes around detected fruits and label them by type (e.g., apple, banana).
   
2. **Freshness Classification**: After detecting the fruits, each fruit image will be passed to a freshness classification model, which will assign a freshness score or category (e.g., "Good Fruit," "Bad Fruit") based on visual indicators of freshness.
   
3. **Real-Time Display**: The system will overlay bounding boxes, fruit labels, and freshness scores on the video in real time, providing a visual representation of freshness for each fruit in the frame.

## Expected Outcome
The final output will be a video demonstrating the systemâ€™s functionality in a real-world scenario. The video will showcase the model's ability to detect and classify the freshness of various fruits in a grocery store, framing each fruit with its type and freshness score. This demonstration will highlight the potential for real-time freshness assessment in retail environments, contributing to better quality control and reduced food waste.

## Significance
This project is a novel application of computer vision, aligning with the goal of using learned techniques to solve a real-world problem. By providing a practical tool for freshness detection, it has implications for sustainability, food quality assurance, and operational efficiency in grocery stores. The system can support retail staff in maintaining high standards of produce freshness, ultimately benefiting both consumers and store management.
